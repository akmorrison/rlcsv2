\section{Analysis/testing}
Here's why this doesn't break a bunch of rules.

\subsection{Design, Test, \& Evaluation Guide}
\subsubsection{Rule 2.2 - PROPULSION SYSTEM SAFING AND ARMING}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries ``A propulsion system is considered armed if only one action 
(eg an ignition signal) must occur for the propellant(s) to ignite''}

Our propellant is really hard to ignite. We've performed numerous tests to determine
if our fuel grain (main propellant) can be ignited without nitrous oxide present.
We've never managed to ignite it. Using that as precedent, we can say
that our ignition system isn't armed until oxidizer is present in our flight tank.
Since oxidizer alone isn't enough to ignite our propellant without extreme heat also
present, you could make the argument that our ignition system isn't really armed until
the ignition puck is burning \textit{and} there is oxidizer present in our flight tank.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Rule 2.2.1 - GROUND-START IGNITION CIRCUIT ARMING}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries ``All ground-started propulsion system ignition circuits/sequences shall not be ``armed'' until all personnel are at least
50 ft (15 m) away from the launch vehicle.''}

Our operations procedures ensure that there is never oxidizer in our flight tank
until we are ready to launch, and all personnel are already at the minimum safe
distance away from the rocket. We do not arm our ignition sequences until all
personnel are much further than 15m away from the vehicle.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Rule 2.2.3 - PROPELLANT OFFLOADING AFTER LAUNCH ABORT}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries ``Hybrid and liquid propulsion systems shall implement a means for remotely controlled venting or offloading of all
liquid and gaseous propellants in the event of a launch abort''}

We have a 0.3mm diameter hole in series with an electrically controlled valve in our
rocket to facilitate offloading of all liquid propellant in the event of an abort.
Before going to the competition, we perform a full systems integration test in which
we fill the rocket with CO$_2$ and then vent all of it to ensure that this system is
operational and functions properly. TODO Jacob do we still do this?
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Rule 3.4 - SAFETY CRITICAL WIRING}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries ``Safety critical wiring is defined as electrical wiring associated with recovery system
deployment events and any ``air started'' rocket motors''}

This system is in no way associated with either of those things, which is why
it does not (in some minor places) comply with the safety critical wiring
standard.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Rule 4.1 - ENERGETIC DEVICE SAFING AND ARMING}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries ``All energetics shall be safed until the rocket is in the launch position, at which point they may be ``armed''. An energetic
device is considered safed when two separate events are necessary to release the energy''}

Our ignition system contains two nichrome igniters embedded in a flammable solid
fuel puck, which is the only energetic associated with this system. Until the
rocket is mounted on the rail, these igniters are shorted and are not connected
to the system, and thus they are not armed, since you'd have to un-short them and
then plug them in before the energy can be released.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{10.1 EQUIPMENT PORTABILITY}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries ``Teams should make their launch support equipment man-portable over a short distance (a few
hundred feet)''}

The tower side box component of this system is the heaviest piece, which weighs
12lbs and has a handle on it for ease of portability. The entire system is
easily man portable and can be carried by 2 or 3 people well over a few hundred
feet.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{10.3 OPERATIONAL RANGE}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries ``All team provided launch control systems shall be electronically operated and have a maximum operational range of
no less than 2,000 ft (~610 m) from the launch rail''}

Our system is electronically operated and uses two XBEE-PRO XSC S3B modules
which have an advertised range of 28 miles with line of sight. We used the
exact same modules last year and had no issues with loss of communication.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{10.4 FAULT TOLLERANCE AND ARMING}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries ``All team provided launch control systems shall be at least single fault tolerant by implementing a removable safety
interlock (i.e. a jumper or key to be kept in possession of the arming crew during arming) in series with the launch
switch''}

We use a key switch in series with all other control switches on our client
side box. The key is held by either an IREC official or the arming crew until
the rocket is ready to launch.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{10.5 SAFETY CRITICAL SWITCHES}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries ``All team provided launch control systems shall implement ignition switches of the momentary, normally open (aka
``deadman'') type''}

Our ignition actuation button is momentary and normally open.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{APPENDIX C: FIRE CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN GUIDLINES}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfseries ``The control console should be designed such that two deliberate actions are
required to fire the system''}

Since all switches are in series with the keyswitch, any action taken at the
control box really takes 4 deliberate actions (put key in box, turn key,
flip up switch cover, actuate switch). Because the ignition fire button is
in series with two missile switches, firing the system takes 5 deliberate
actions, and 5 is greater than two for all values of 5 (insert key, turn key,
flip up switch cover, actuate switch, press button).

\item {\bfseries ``The system should include a power interrupt such that firing current cannot be
sent to the firing leads while personnel are at the pad and this interrupt
should be under the control of personnel at the pad.''}

Does the keyswitch count?

\item {\bfseries ``The failure of any single component should not compromise the safety of the
firing system.''}

Our ignition system requires at minimum 3 separate actions to occur (open fill valve, send 
ignition current, open injector valve) before our ignition system actuates. There is no
single component that can fail that would cause all three of these actions to occur (unless
a microcontroller fails in an impossibly specific and malicious way), and thus our the
safety of our system would never be compromised by a single component's failure. All subsystems
are designed to fail safe (certain valves close in the event of communications loss, there
are inline fuses on all actuator power lines, etc) in the event of component failure.

% begin Checklists -- {{{
\section{Assembly and Pre-Launch Checklists}
The order of operations:
\begin{checklist}
    \item When RLCS takes over, here's the current state of our fill system: 
    \begin{checklist}
        \item The NOs K bottle's cylinder valve is open 
        \item The plumbing system is set up, all valves are closed (except series
              fill)
        \item The only pressurized line is the fill line (leads from cylinder to
              remote fill valve). All other lines are atmospheric.
    \end{checklist}
    \item The primary operator marks the current fill line pressure (reads from SP1)
    \item The primary operator opens the rocket vent valve, which will allow the
            rocket to be fuelled.
    \item The primary operator opens the remote fill valve, pressurizing the feed
            line.  Oxidizer begins to flow into the run tank, while fumes vent from the
            top of the run tank through the rocket vent valve. At this moment (oxidizer in
            the run tank), our ignition system and rocket are considered armed. All
            personnel must be at the Minimum safe distance before this point.
    \item Once the rocket is fuelled (as indicated be the primary load cell and rocket
            pressure transducer), the rocket vent valve is closed, sealing the run tank.
    \item The remote fill valve is closed, sealing the supply tank off from the rest
            of the plumbing assembly.  
    \item The remote vent valve is opened, venting the feed line, so that is at
            atmospheric pressure. The goal of this step is to allow the remote
            disconnect arm to swing free without spraying the airframe of the rocket
            with oxidizer.
    \item The remote disconnect pin is pulled, allowing the fill arm to swing free.
            The rocket is now disconnected from the fill system, and ready to launch.
            because of the one way check valve in the rocket, the nitrous does not vent
            through the fill arm adapter)
    \item Once the IREC official says so, we can actuate ignition and launch:
    \begin{checklist}
        \item Ignition is fired, igniting the puck in the CC.
        \item Once we have confirmation of flame in the CC (read from ammeter on
                ignition circuit), we open the injector valve.
        \item Watch the rocket, because this'll be pretty cool.
    \end{checklist}
\end{checklist}

\section{DFMEA}
%Let's look at every single component in our ignition system and beat this horse
%until it's \_definitely\_ dead. And then keep going for a while
%Components:
%Ignition cable
%    If the ignition cable fails short, no current will be able to pass through
%the nichrome ignition cables, and our ignition system will not be able to
%actuate.
%
%Power signal wire
%    If the power signal wire fails open (breaks), the power relay mosfet will
%not conduct, since its gate is pulled down by a mosfet pulldown resistor. This
%will make us unable to actuate the relay, which is safer than the relay
%actuating without our signal
%
%Direction signal wire
%    See power signal wire. Same considerations apply.
%
%Relay control mosfets
%    If a relay control mosfet fails short (conducting), the relay will
%constantly be closed, and this will be discovered during our prefill electrical
%checks. If it fails short between the time we perform prefill electrical checks
%and launch time, we'll be fine, since both relays are required to close before
%current is sent to the rocket
%
%Current sensing shunt resistor
%    If the current sensing shunt resistor fails open, no current will be sent to
%our ignition coils, and ignition will not actuate. If if fails closed, the
%operator will not see any current reading on the display, and may not realize
%the ignition has actuate. In this case, the operator would not open the injector
%valve, and our fuel grain would not ignite.
%
%Current sensing amplifier
%    If the current sensing amplifier fails shorting the signal input to ground,
%no current will be sent to the ignition coils. If it fails in another way, the
%operator will not see a current reading on the display and will not continue
%with launch proceudres.
%
%Current sensing power rail bypass capacitor
%    If these capacitors fail, they won't immediately harm the system, but may
%shorten the life of the current sensing amplifiers. Since those can die without
%compromising the safety of our system, we aren't worried about them failing.
%
%Fuse
%    The fuse is designed to fail open if too much current is drawn. If it fails
%open before ignition, no current will be sent ot our ignition coils, and nothing
%unsafe will happen.
%
%Flyback Diodes
%    If the flyback diodes fail short, no current will go through the 
%
%Limit switch resistors
%
%Mosfet pulldown resistors
%
%Mosfet gate series resistors

%Direction Relay (DPDT)

%Power Relay (SPST)
