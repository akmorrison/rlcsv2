Sanity check before buying components:
Going to check the data sheet and make sure that I haven't screwed up the math somewhere.

All components:

7 segment display:
data sheet specs:
	- common anode
	- 2v forward voltage per led (2.6v max)
	- 20mA forward current at 2v (typical)
	- 25mA rated continuous current (we're running 20mA)
	- 5v rated reverse voltage (we should never have any)
things that drive the 7 segment display:
bjt emitter follower:
data sheet specs:
	- 6v Veb max rating
	- 600mA continuous collector current (we're driving 160mA max)
	- 225mW thermal dissipation (at 1V 160mA we're burning about 2/3's of that, and we're running 50% duty cycle)
	- collector emitter breakdown of 40V (we're applying 5)
	- collector base breakdown of 60V (again, max of 5)
	- minimum current gain of 100 at 150mA
	- base-emitter saturation voltage of .75 to .95v (collector emitter saturation max of .4 at 150mA, so we're limited by Vbe)

So just checking math here, with an led drop of 2V, and a base emitter drop of .75 volts, we've got 2.25 volts left to get rid of
To ensure 20mA, we'd need 2.25/.02 = 112.5 ohms. Given that we have 150ohm resistors on hand, I'm probably just gonna use those,
which results in 15mA of diode current, which should be enough (this needs testing, data sheet does not list minimum current. This is breadboardable).

With a current gain of 100 (minimum), and an emitter current of 160mA (maximum), there should be a base current of 160/(100+1) = 1.6mA, which is nothing for the arduino to source. The arduino needs to sink 20mA (max, typical 15) on each pin, but that is well within spec.

Lastly, we have 150ohm 0805 resistors taking 20mA (max, 15 typical) of current, which equals out to 60mW of power dissipation, well within the 1/8W power rating that they have (safety factor just better than 2).

Sd card:
	- checked footprint, there are no other specs for this. Calling that a day

Power Converters:
VXO7803-1000:
	- input range of 6v to 36v dc
	- output current up to 1amp (shouldn't need nearly that much, but maybe necessary for Xbee which draws up to 250mA, plus sd card, plus another peripheral)
	- overspecced, but meant to be general, so that's fine.
	- checked 1.2mm holes on footprint
	- datasheet recommends 10uF cap on input, 22uF cap on output. (there's another circuit for EMC recommendations, but that's way overkill).
	- switching frequency of 420-620KHz
	- operating temperature up to 85 C
VXO7805-1000:
	- input range of 8v to 36v dc
	- output current up to 1amp
	- Same datasheet recommendations as the 3v3 volt one, they're almost identical
VEFT1-S12-S15-SMT-TR:
	- input voltage 10.8v to 13.2v
	- output current 67mA (don't drive anything more than the 2 pressure transducers off of this)
	- recommended output cap of 2.2uF
	- recommended output cap of 1uF
	- for best performance, don't short 0vout to gnd, so we'll use a signal ground (the proper way).




Note, you can run arduino's off of 12v dc (you could power them straight off the battery), but then you're using the onboard regulator, which will get hot at higher loads. By putting an external regulator, we lower the risk that the arduino will overheat in the desert.
