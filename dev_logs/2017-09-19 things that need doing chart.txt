BEHOLD,
My beautifully hand aligned flow chart for all the work that still needs doing on RLCS in order to be ready for an engine test
This is as the project stood on Tuesday September 19, 2017. Note, this isn't everything that needs to be done pre IREC. That's a whole nother list

This chart probably looks really weird if you're not using a monospaced font. So please use one.
Also, it'll wrap if your screen is too narrow. The chart is 121 columns wide. So your screen needs to be that wide.

Below the chart is a description of what works need doing for each little box. There's really not that much per box, but there's a lot of boxes.
If you want to know what's going on in the project, this would probably be a good spot to start. As items get finished, I'll check them off of the RLCS trello page, and also I'll let everyone know the item is done on the slack RLCS channel

Radio Tree:
    - Test UART Range: We need to know if the 5V UART connection we currently use to connect the XBees to the Arduino will work at the range we need it to (20 or 30 feet). This isn't a huge undertaking. Just get a 30 foot wire, attach one end to the 5v UART breakout board, attach one end to the arduino, and see if the pixies can carry the magic electron bits from one to another
        - Figure out signal repeaters: If that doesn't work, we'll need repeaters. TI makes some IC's for this. They aren't expensive, but they'll be a pain to wire in. Better than using coax, but not by a lot.
        - Power: Repeaters need power, so we'll need to see if the wire can just carry that power or if we need a battery and stepper at the top of the tower. I don't think we'll need a battery, but we should probably check.
    - Design and print radio board: the xbee is a breakout. It'll need a pcb to sit on (unless we can get away with the ones we used previously, which were store bought off digikey)
    - Make housing: 3D print a case so that we don't have a Radio PCB just hanging around, being all fragile and whatnot
    - Manufacture cables: Just put connectors on the ends of some lengths of CAT5 cable
    - Figure out tower attachment: We need something on the tower to hold the housing up high. This probably isn't necessary for the integration test, but it'd be good to figure out soon. We need to talk to Em about this likely. Or Hilbert. Whichever of them is dealing with the tower.
    - Figure out client side heighteners: We need the client side radio up high. So we need a thing to do that.
    - Range test: Go to a field or something and make sure the radios can talk at range. Again, this isn't necessary to do pre engine test, but it needs to be done at some point, and sooner is better.

Client side Tree:
    - Source Box: Boxes are expensive. I've emailed pelican and Nanuk, but I should email them again, since they seem to have lost the emails.
    - Layout interface: Talk to Miranda about how she wants switches and displays laid out. I have a handwritten note on this somewhere, I'll copy into a devlog at some point.
    - Power board (also found in the tower side tree): Design a board to step power. And put an SD card on it to log data. And also put a seven segment display on there to print out debug information. Not a hugely cool or difficult problem, but it needs to get done relatively soon.
    - Panel Design & Manufacture: It needs to be laser cut. Before that it needs to be autocaded. This is largely based on the interface we lay out in the previous box.
    - Buy Switches, LCDs, wire, and Arduino: Probably need an Arduino mega for both. We have some switches left over from v1, but we'll need a new display and arduino. Need to investigate whether we're ok to use cheap Chinese knockoffs or if we need to pay $100 for a couple Arduinos
    - Modify Code: We have code left over from v1. The main structure doesn't need to change that much, but the code needs to be expanded and cleaned up a little. Also unit tested.
    - Assemble: This is mostly just wiring. Get that cable management though.
    - Test: Individually testing this component needs it's whole own note. Suffice to say it can be done in like a day with a checklist and a multimeter.

Tower Side Tree:
    - Source Box: Same as above. They're expensive, and I want a good one.
    - Mounting Plate: Another laser cut thing. Another Autocad thing. I want to mount all the components on standoffs screwed into a laser cut acrylic plate for robustness and for that sweet sweet aesthetic and easy cable management. We did a similar thing with v1, but I'd like strain relief built into this one. It's mostly an autocad job. And it needs an acrylic plate laser cut. Not a whole lot of new stuff, but gonna be a bit of work.
    - Buy Arduino and Wires: Same as above. Another mega is required, but I'd like to see if we can get away with a cheap chinesium board.
    - Modify Code: Similar to above.
    - Assembly: Similar to above. Wiring and screwing things into things and making sure that when you shake the box it doesn't fall to pieces.
    - Test: hook up valves, hook up computer, make sure valves turn and it never freezes, even if you send it garbled data.
